</div>


<div id="draggable1" class="box" style="margin-left:600px; margin-top:400px;">
<p>The spectacle is not a collection of images; rather, it is a social
  relationship between people that is meditated by images.</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable2" class="box" style="margin-left:1000px; margin-top:200px;">
<p>The spectacle cannot be understood either as a deliberate
  distortion of the visual world or as a product of the technology
  of the mass dissemination of images. It is far better viewed as
  a weltanschauung that has been actualized, translated into the
  material realm — a world view transformed into an objective force.</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable3"  class="box" style="margin-left:550px; margin-top:170px;">
<p>The spectacle is capital to such a degree of accumulation that it becomes an image.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable4"  class="box" style="margin-left:150px; margin-top:400px;">
<p>Images detached from every aspect of life merge into a common stream,
  and the former unity of life is lost forever. Apprehended in a partial way,
  reality unfolds in a new generality as a pseudo-world apart, solely as an
  object of contemplation. The tendency toward the specialization of
  images-of-the-world finds its highest expression in the world of the
  autonomous image, where deceit deceives itself. The spectacle in its
  generality is a concrete inversion of life, and, as such, the autonomous movement of non-life.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable13" class="box" style="margin-left:900px; margin-top:50px;">
<img src="grace.png" style="width:200px; height:280px;">
</div>

<div id="draggable5"  class="box" style="margin-left:40px; margin-top:40px;">
<p>This is the principle of commodity fetishism, the domination of society by
  “intangible as well as tangible things,” which reaches its absolute fulfillment
  in the spectacle, where the tangible world is replaced by a selection of images
  which exist above it, and which simultaneously impose themselves as the tangible
  par excellence.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable6"  class="box" style="margin-left:250px; margin-top:100px;">
<p>Where the real world changes into simple images, the simple images become
  real beings and effective motivations of hypnotic behavior. The spectacle,
  as a tendency to make one see the world by means of various specialized
  mediations (it can no longer be grasped directly), naturally finds vision
  to be the privileged human sense which the sense of touch was for other epochs.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable7"  class="box" style="margin-left:800px; margin-top:260px;">
<p>The most abstract, the most mystifiable sense corresponds to the
  generalized abstraction of present-day society. But the spectacle
  is not identifiable with mere gazing, even combined with hearing.
  It is that which escapes the activity of men, that which escapes
  reconsideration and correction by their work. It is the opposite
  of dialogue. Wherever there is independent representation, the spectacle
  reconstitutes itself.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable8"  class="box" style="margin-left:960px; margin-top:60px;">
<p>To describe the spectacle, its formation, its functions and the forces which
  tend to dissolve it, one must artificially distinguish certain inseparable
  elements. When analyzing the spectacle one speaks, to some extent, the language
  of the spectacular itself in the sense that one moves through the methodological
  terrain of the very society which expresses itself in the spectacle.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable9"  class="box" style="margin-left:850px; margin-top:600px;">
<p>The spectacle is nothing other than the sense of the total practice
  of a social-economic formation, its use of time.
  It is the historical movement in which we are caught.
</p>
