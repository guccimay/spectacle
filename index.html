<div id="draggable" class="box" style="margin-left:400px; margin-top:200px;">
<img src="leak.png" style="width:200px; height:280px;">
</div>


<div id="draggable1" class="box" style="margin-left:600px; margin-top:400px;">
<p>The spectacle is not a collection of images; rather, it is a social
  relationship between people that is meditated by images.</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable2" class="box" style="margin-left:1000px; margin-top:200px;">
<p>The spectacle cannot be understood either as a deliberate
  distortion of the visual world or as a product of the technology
  of the mass dissemination of images. It is far better viewed as
  a weltanschauung that has been actualized, translated into the
  material realm — a world view transformed into an objective force.</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable3"  class="box" style="margin-left:550px; margin-top:170px;">
<p>The spectacle is capital to such a degree of accumulation that it becomes an image.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable4"  class="box" style="margin-left:150px; margin-top:400px;">
<p>Images detached from every aspect of life merge into a common stream,
  and the former unity of life is lost forever. Apprehended in a partial way,
  reality unfolds in a new generality as a pseudo-world apart, solely as an
  object of contemplation. The tendency toward the specialization of
  images-of-the-world finds its highest expression in the world of the
  autonomous image, where deceit deceives itself. The spectacle in its
  generality is a concrete inversion of life, and, as such, the autonomous movement of non-life.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable13" class="box" style="margin-left:900px; margin-top:50px;">
<img src="grace.png" style="width:200px; height:280px;">
</div>

<div id="draggable5"  class="box" style="margin-left:20px; margin-top:40px;">
<p>This is the principle of commodity fetishism, the domination of society by
  “intangible as well as tangible things,” which reaches its absolute fulfillment
  in the spectacle, where the tangible world is replaced by a selection of images
  which exist above it, and which simultaneously impose themselves as the tangible
  par excellence.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable6"  class="box" style="margin-left:250px; margin-top:100px;">
<p>Where the real world changes into simple images, the simple images become
  real beings and effective motivations of hypnotic behavior. The spectacle,
  as a tendency to make one see the world by means of various specialized
  mediations (it can no longer be grasped directly), naturally finds vision
  to be the privileged human sense which the sense of touch was for other epochs.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable7"  class="box" style="margin-left:800px; margin-top:260px;">
<p>The most abstract, the most mystifiable sense corresponds to the
  generalized abstraction of present-day society. But the spectacle
  is not identifiable with mere gazing, even combined with hearing.
  It is that which escapes the activity of men, that which escapes
  reconsideration and correction by their work. It is the opposite
  of dialogue. Wherever there is independent representation, the spectacle
  reconstitutes itself.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable8"  class="box" style="margin-left:960px; margin-top:560px;">
<p>To describe the spectacle, its formation, its functions and the forces which
  tend to dissolve it, one must artificially distinguish certain inseparable
  elements. When analyzing the spectacle one speaks, to some extent, the language
  of the spectacular itself in the sense that one moves through the methodological
  terrain of the very society which expresses itself in the spectacle.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable9"  class="box" style="margin-left:850px; margin-top:750px;">
<p>The spectacle is nothing other than the sense of the total practice
  of a social-economic formation, its use of time.
  It is the historical movement in which we are caught.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable22"  class="box" style="margin-left:20px; margin-top:1000px;">
<p>Separation is the alpha and omega of the spectacle. The institutionalization of
  the social division of labor, the formation of classes, had given rise to a first
  sacred contemplation, the mythical order with which every power shrouds itself from
  the beginning. The sacred has justified the cosmic and ontological order which
  corresponded to the interests of the masters; it has explained and embellished
  that which society could not do. Thus all separate power has been spectacular,
  but the adherence of all to an immobile image only signified the common acceptance
  of an imaginary prolongation of the poverty of real social activity, still largely
  felt as a unitary condition.
</p>

</div>

<div id="draggable18" class="box" style="margin-left:500px; margin-top:850px;">
  <p>The spectacle within society corresponds to a concrete manufacture of alienation.
    Economic expansion is mainly the expansion of this specific industrial production.
    What grows with the economy in motion for itself can only be the very alienation
    which was at its origin.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="draggable19" class="box" style="margin-left:200px; margin-top:850px;">
<img src="colortv.png" style="width:200px; height:280px;">
</div>

<div id="draggable20"  class="box" style="margin-left:650px; margin-top:600px;">
<p>The society which rests on modern industry is not accidentally or
  superficially spectacular, it is fundamentally spectaclist.
  In the spectacle, which is the image of the ruling economy,
  the goal is nothing, development everything. The spectacle aims at
  nothing other than itself.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable21"  class="box" style="margin-left:450px; margin-top:500px;">
<p>To the extent that necessity is socially dreamed, the dream becomes necessary.
  The spectacle is the nightmare of imprisoned modern society which ultimately
  expresses nothing more than its desire to sleep. The spectacle is the guardian of sleep.
</p>
</div>


<div id="draggable23"  class="box" style="margin-left:700px; margin-top:950px;">
<img src="circus.png" style="width:200px; height:280px;">
</div>

<div id="draggable14" class="box" style="margin-left:300px; margin-top:600px;">
<img src="casino.png" style="width:200px; height:280px;">
</div>

<div id="draggable24"  class="box" style="margin-left:350px; margin-top:800px;">
<p>In the inverted reality of the spectacle, use value (which was implicitly
  contained in exchange value) must now be explicitly proclaimed precisely
  because its factual reality is eroded by the overdeveloped commodity economy
  and because counterfeit life requires a pseudo-justification.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable25"  class="box" style="margin-left:950px; margin-top:150px;">
<p>The spectacle is the other side of money: it is the general abstract
  equivalent of all commodities.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable26" class="box" style="margin-left:560px; margin-top:540px;">

<div id="draggable36"  class="box" style="margin-left:560px; margin-top:1400px;">
<p>Let the designer take on the debate with the institutions,
  the brand names or the political parties, without it all
  being about getting the job or having the job fail. Let
  designers do some serious reading and writing of their own.
  Let designers offer the surplus value, the uselessness and
  the authorship of their profession to the world, to politics, to society.
</p>
</div>

<div id="draggable37"  class="box" style="margin-left:260px; margin-top:1300px;">
<p>Ewan Lentjes wrote that designers are not thinkers,
   even though their primary task is thorough reflection on
   the work they do. Making art without making art, doing by not doing,
    contemplating without thinking.
