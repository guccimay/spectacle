Living in the Capitalist society, heavily centered on consumer culture,
as the first Internet Generation often feels like fighting through a narrow
hall of flashing imagery and shocking news. Walls we pass by are plastered
with excessively saturated advertisements, repelling words and graphic images.
As soon as the corporations adopted social media, they merged into the
contemporary mass media; as a result, consumers were bombarded with
information that seems endless. Scrolling down Facebook, Instagram and
Twitter became an essential part of daily routines for not only the youth
(as known as “Millennials”) but also the general public involved with business,
advertising, marketing and public relations.
<br><br>
The Spectacle is an idea that has been studied by philosophers,
theorists and artists for over several centuries. First usage of “spectacular”
was used in “The Psalter” in 1340, written by Richard Rolle of Hampoles, United Kingdom.
Since then, performance artists, public speakers and even politicians used the
idea of Spectacle as a strategy to communicate with the audience. Guy Debord,
wrote the infamous “The Society of the Spectacle” in 1967, as part of the Situationist
movement. Debord criticized the alienation of consumer culture, commodity feitishism,
class alienation, cultural homogenization and the flaws of mass media.
These 221 articles of ideas, most of them are still relevant to issues the
contemporary culture currently has.
<br><br>
The questions I want to ask with the project Spectacular Spectacular: <br>
1. What makes a spectacle? <br>
2. How did the idea of spectacle evolve over time? <br>
3. What was once considered “spectacle” in the past a “norm” now? <br>
4. How do people conceive Spectacle differently? <br>
5.What relationship does Spectacle have with the contemporary consumer culture,
in the lense of visual culture? <br>
	(i.e. How is graphic design used in current Spectacles?)<br>
<br><br>
By researching writings on Spectacle, written by Jean Baudrillard, Guy Debord,
Bruce Mau, David Rockwell, Baz Kershaw, Hal Foster, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, Douglas
Kellner, Michel Foucault, Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer, Claire Bishop, Daniel van
der Velden, I was able to form my own perception on the Spectacle. Continuously
overplayed shock values desensitize the audience, and graphic design in contemporary
 culture is influenced by the visual language that borrows a lot from the Spectacles
  of the past. With this project, I wish to challenge the audience to think
  critically of what they consume. I also wish to challenge aspiring graphic
   designer peers to critically observe our role in society, and grow
  together as socially responsible designers.
