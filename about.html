Graphic Design as Spectacle
</br>
</br>
 The word spectacle comes from Latin root spectare, meaning “to view” or “to watch.”</br>
Spectacle was considered as an important element of theater performance in its earliest definition,</br>
as part of six components of tragedy defined by Aristotle’s Poetics<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. The description of spectacle</br>
then expanded rapidly to include vast array of contexts with the development of media. </br>
In Guy Debord’s 1967 work The Society of the Spectacle, its definition is expanded as </br>
“the spectacle is simply the common language that bridges this division [between reality </br>
and hyperreality]. Spectators are linked by a one-way relationship to the very center that </br>
maintains their isolation from one another. The spectacle thus unites what is separate, </br>
but it unites it only in its separateness.” It’s in this quote that one encounters the </br>
evolution of attitude towards “watching” as well as the issues in the performance of spectacle, </br>
which he argues is a “one-way relationship.” The spectacle then unites the spectators by forcing </br>
them to participate and engage (within the dynamic of an isolating relationship). </br></br>

It seems impossible to grasp or redefine what spectacle would be in contemporary culture where </br>
information and images are flooding our world. Society is too experienced to avoid the forced </br>
“one-way” engagement, or the physical performance of spectacle. Simply avoidable by deactivating </br>
social media accounts or not attending performance art events. Designers persist on creating </br>
spectacles to engage or construct a so-called “user-experience.” The ubiquitous infusion of </br>
design in every aspect of society lives unnoticed, as we fanatically praise the Crystal Goblet. </br>
However, the real problems that are deeply rooted aren’t always evident—commodity racism in </br>
package design [Figure 1], gendered bathrooms, prisons, cultural appropriation and even the </br>
clients you are working for who support unethical organizations. Redesigning the website won’t </br>
solve the problem, producing more pins won’t save the world, so what do we do to design with </br>
social responsibility? </br></br>

In 1994, Jean Baudrillard famously wrote on hyperreality in Simulacra and Simulation, </br>
defining the term as “the generation by models of a real without origin or reality.” </br>
This is to say, a sign or representation without an origin to simulate. As designed realities </br>
continue to take root in the relationship between people and world, it’s crucial to recognize</br> 
the responsibility in being a designer. In Baudrillard’s criticism of hyperreality, he points </br>
to the blurred line between reality and simulacra as a point of danger. Being a designer in </br>
contemporary visual culture means working directly in the medium of spectacle and being </br>
responsible for the public sphere it contributes to. Scrolling down Facebook, Instagram </br>
and Twitter has become a crucial part of daily routines for not only the youth (specifically </br>
“Millennials”) but also the general public involved with business, advertising, marketing, </br>
public relations, and everything, really. </br></br>

In understanding design as spectacle, it’s necessary to properly place what is canonized </br>
as propaganda. The canonization of coercive techniques removes those techniques’ potency,</br> 
so when one studies the 20th century hypnotic brainwashing posters of the Nazi party that </br>
plastered the walls of Germany, we recognize the thin nature of its tactics. The poster </br>
was a medium that was easily mass-produced, that could reach large audiences ranging from </br>
the hearts of cities to small towns in suburbs. Realizing the power of imagery and repetitive </br>
messages, they attempted to familiarize bias into the lives of the general public. </br></br>

Nazi propaganda in 1930s was one of the most active use of design in political movement. </br>
Designers started to think about accessibility and mass production, and beyond publishing </br>
a book (even though Mein Kampf of 1926 did massively spread the ideas of National Socialism </br>
to general public.) Hitler and Joseph Goebbels established Reich Ministry of Public </br>
Enlightenment and Propaganda in late 1930s, which aimed to “ensure that the Nazi message </br>
was successfully communicated through art, music, theater, films, books, radio, educational </br>
materials and the press.” Depicting the enemy as the Nazi regime envisioned became effortless </br>
after sound and color revolution in filmmaking. The Eternal Jew (1940), an anti-semitic film </br>
directed by Fritz Hippler [figure 2], insensitively portray Jews as “plague”, comparing them </br>
to footage of rats that are destructing and contaminating food. Similar political propaganda </br>
occurred in U.S. at the time against Japanese during WW2, as shown in the famously banned </br>
cartoon Tokio Jokio (1942), produced by Leon Shlesinger production and one of the biggest </br>
film corporations until present, Warner Bros. [Figure 3] In this cartoon, Japanese broadcasters </br>
and characters are given stereotypes–exaggerated accents, body language, and physical </br>
appearance–which unfortunately still lives in dominant ideology until today. </br>

As the government recruited artists to produce government propaganda, private-sector propaganda </br>
began to fight against the forceful messages. Driven by the need to start a revolution against </br>
police brutality inflicted upon African-American people, the Black Panther Party was established </br>
by activists Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. Newton described their group’s symbol, Black Panther, </br>
as the animal that “doesn’t strike first, but if the aggressor strikes first, then he’ll attack.” </br>
The group was formed specifically with the title “for Self-Defense,” and as such, used imagery </br>
that embodied the traits of a provoked force fighting against systemic and institutionalized </br>
racism and empowered African-American communities. The Black Panthers used posters to promote </br>
and emphasize their voice, often carrying flags of printed logo of Black Panther and the fist </br>
of Black Power [Figure 4].  </br></br>

After the civil rights movement, including Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act </br>
of 1968, more artist communities joined in the conversation of equality and social responsibility. </br>
In 1977, Jenny Holzer made a body of work titled Truisms, which she “typeset the sentences in </br>
alphabetical order and printed them inexpensively, using commercial printing processes. </br>
She then distributed the sheets at random and pasted them up as posters around the city. [They] </br>
eventually adorned a variety of formats, including T-shirts and baseball caps [Figure 5-1].” </br>
Holzer wrote a series of witty, political and thought-provoking statements in a repetitive format </br>
that she later printed on shirts and posters. Using the simplest formal qualities, such as cheap </br>
colored paper and typeset Futura Oblique (as also used in Barbara Kruger’s text work), Holzer </br>
was successful to get her message across the world, even gaining opportunities to project her </br>
statements in large scale onto the government owned buildings [Figure 5-2]. Following Holzer’s </br>
public conversations, AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) formed in March 1987 in New York, </br>
collecting artists around the city to create public works to rebel against silence doctors </br>
who rejected proposals to research the causes of AIDS. One of the founding members </br>
of ACT UP, Jason Baumann, designed Silence = Death poster in 1987 [Figure 6]. “In essence </br>
and intention, the political poster is a public thing. It comes to life in the public sphere, </br>
and is academic outside of it. [The poster] is a product of collective world-making, </br>
the sort of collectivity which moves every one of us, as individuals and as a culture, </br>
and which is transformative.” ACT UP members agreed that when New Yorkers need to talk </br>
to each other, “there is always the street.” To open the public lines of communication, </br>
they worked on the poster to become a powerful symbol of LGBT activism at the time.  </br>
As Baumann explains, most of the posters on streets are meant to be “declarative, provocative, </br>
and meant to stimulate inquiry.”</br></br>

The poster as the spectacle, as a thought-provoking medium, seems to be relevant to this day. </br>
For more recent example, Ficciones Typografika is a curatorial practice based on collective design, </br>
founded by Erik Brandt. Brandt is based in Minneapolis, where he curates three wooden bulletin </br>
boards outside his personal home with works submitted from designers around the world [Figure 7]. </br>
Brandt curates the posters that illustrates a zeitgeist, or that exemplify experimentation that </br>
pushes the boundaries of graphic design. The recent Nike ad that featured Serena Williams </br>
[Figure 8] as “greatest athlete ever” with the world “female” crossed out, successfully sparked </br>
conversations within the sports community about sexism that regularly affects female athletes </br>
in not only income but also career development.</br></br>

Spectacle in the contemporary society appears to open itself to easy co-optation. Its frequent </br>
use by corporations, institutions and politicians who abuse the power of spectacle is significant. </br>
When the shock of spectacle repeats itself and stand back to back with other spectacles on the </br>
billboards, screens and publications, it eventually becomes a massive explosion that desensitizes </br>
the spectators (the readers, the audience.) The ad-funded news providers overplaying the graphic </br>
videos of police brutality, overdrawing attention to unnecessary spectacles (celebrity gossip, </br>
false scandals, articles with no fact-checking), and emphasizing false hyperreal imagery </br>
(hyper-real photoshopped models) deliver heavily biased, unfiltered information to the spectators. </br>
Spectacle can be used in a way to provoke critical thinking and begin conversations about devalued </br>
issues, which contemporary graphic designers can take a big part in, especially in the fields of </br>
marketing, advertising and mainly, the mass media. </br></br>

As the World Wide Web grew in accessibility in the 90s, the art world also shifted towards </br>
the new medium—digital media. What the internet offered was far more shocking than the televised </br>
spectacle of the Vietnam War in the 1960s. As Misha Kavka criticized globalized media culture, </br>
the public no longer recognizes the external [or, the physical] world as real. Kavka also stressed </br>
that Reality TV programming could be simultaneously compelling and threatening because these </br>
programs’ ability to bridge the once-firm division between spectacle and experience, between </br>
the staged event and actuality, through mediated intimacy. When corporations began to add social </br>
media to their marketing media, they merged into the contemporary mass media; as a result, </br>
consumers were bombarded with information that seems endless. The mass media deeply understands </br>
the power of imagery in Samuel Weber wrote in 2002, in War, Terrorism and Spectacle, “in order </br>
for something to be a spectacle, it must, first of all, take place. Which is to say, it must be </br>
localizable. Whether inside, in a theater (of whatever kind), or outside, in the open, a spectacle </br>
must be placed in order to be seen (or heard).” All things we design take place, out in the world. </br>
The responsibility that comes with our task get underestimated too often. In both Kavka and </br>
Weber’s arguments, they stress concerns on banality of creators of the spectacle–whether it’s </br>
blurring the line between virtual reality and reality or (from designer’s perspective,) simply </br>
publishing your projects into public sphere. It’s a critique on not bringing in enough fresh sets </br>
of eyes, on not spending enough time thinking, on not doing enough research on history of given </br>
content and on not spending enough time and budget to create an ethical work environment.</br></br>
