  In 1994, Jean Baudrillard wrote on hyperreality in Simulacra and Simulation,
  defining the term as “the generation by models of a real without origin or reality.”
  Baudrillard critiqued the danger of hyperreality, questioning the danger of blurred
  fine line between reality and simulacra. Baudrillard was heavily inspired by Marshall
   McLuhan’s Medium is the Message, especially ideas that were built on phenomenology
   and semiotics. As the World Wide Web grew to be more popular and accessible in the
   90s, the art world also shifted gear towards the new medium — digital media.
   The fast-paced development came off rather intimidating than exciting, especially
   when the entire world (Globalization) came along. Artists were not only fascinated
  but threatened by global scale interaction and communication that internet had
  created. What internet offered was far more shocking than the televised spectacle of
  Vietnam War in 1960s. Misha Kavka criticized the globalized media culture, and argued
  that the public no longer recognized the external [or, the physical] world as real.
  Kavka also stressed that Reality TV could be both compelling and threatening because
  these programs bridge the once-firm division between spectacle and experience,
  between the staged event and actuality, through mediated intimacy. Contemporary
  Capitalist-American society, heavily based in consumer culture, debilitates social
  participation by constantly bombarding the general public with chaos. Walls we pass
  by are plastered with excessively saturated advertisements, repelling words and graphic images. As soon as the corporations adopted social media, they merged into the contemporary mass media; as a result, consumers were bombarded with information that seems endless. The mass media deeply understands the power of imagery in contemporary visual culture, and tends to abuse the power to manipulate the public. Scrolling down Facebook, Instagram and Twitter became an essential part of daily routines for not only the youth (as known as “Millennials”) but also the general public involved with business, advertising, marketing and public relations. The decision-making is mostly done in the hands of the performer but cannot exist without the spectators. Spectacle leaves the audience no choice of selection.
Samuel Weber wrote in 2002, in War, Terrorism and Spectacle, “in order for somethin
g to be a spectacle, it must, first of all, take place. Which is to say, it must be
 localizable. Whether inside, in a theater (of whatever kind), or outside, in the open, a spectacle must be placed in order to be seen (or heard).” Weber also discusses Guy Debord’s The Society of the Spectacle, where he addresses the lack of human connections in modern society, contemporary consumer culture, commodity fetishism, dealing with issues such as class alienation, cultural homogenization and mass media. Debord argued that “the spectacle is simply the common language that bridges this division [between reality and hyperreality]. Spectators are linked by a one-way relationship to the very center that maintains their isolation from one another. The spectacle thus unites what is separate, but it unites it only in its separateness.” Debord points out the flaws in performance of spectacle, which he argues is the “one-way relationship,” stating that the spectacle unites the spectators together by forcing them to participate and engage. Weber agrees that the spectacle, at least as staged “by the mainstream broadcast media, seeks simultaneously to assuage and exacerbate anxieties of all sorts by providing images to which they can be attached, ostensibly comprehended and above all, removed.”
The word spectacle comes from the roots of Latin spectare, meaning “to view” or “to watch.” The spectacle was considered as an element of performance or theater, which expanded rapidly to vast array of contexts and media since the birth of technology. “Television shows broadcast across a disparate range of locales and times, and reach a spectator audience who may not even be present in one place or time. The spectacle becomes temporally and spatially disseminated in a doubling of meditation so that the individual’s experience of the spectacle is experienced as a mediation of technological apparatus [a digital screen, radio, etc.]” Spectacle is often used as performative element, not only in theater but also in political movement, public speech, advertising and marketing. As technology develops, examples of spectacles also reached broader formats — virtual reality (VR) experience [Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard], 4D theaters, Siri, accessible 3D printing, and the list grows expeditiously.
One of the early use of graphic design as spectacle was to hypnotize and brainstorm the mass by Nazi party, plastering the walls of Germany with powerful images of Hitler and Nazi symbols [Fig 1]. Poster is a medium that was easily mass produced, could reach largely broad audience from the heart of city to small towns in suburbs.
