<p>What makes a spectacle?
How did the idea of spectacle evolve over time?
(What are things once considered “spectacle” in the past a “norm” now?)
How do people conceive spectacle differently? (different perception)
What relationship does spectacle have with the contemporary culture? (in consumer culture and in graphic design)

Deliverable 1: Research combined into website
Digitally archived research seems to be inevitable nowadays. I will put together the ideas that I collected to base my project on, including writings and artworks on the variety of spectacle. Including Baudrillard, Debord, Bruce Mau, David Rockwell, Kershaw, Hal Foster, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, Douglas Kellner, Michel Foucault, Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer, Claire Bishop, Daniel van der Velden. The website will have information floating together, mimicking the physical poster wall I will be building. The images of posters and writings will be merged together, but in different formats.
</br></br>
  Deliverable 2: Poster wall
Medium is the message. Poster is the purest form of graphic design that embraces form, function, composition, type, accessibility, with a long and rich history. The role of poster has been evolving since it began, through war propagandas, activism posters, music show and advertisements, with endless purposes to be redefined and explored. What role does the poster have in the post-Internet era?
Poster is the most affordable method of advertising, to be mass produced and reach broad range of audience. Most of the times, poster walls are combination of overtly saturated images with big, bold and colorful information tangled together. Posters are temporal, unless archived for museum purposes. Posters are collectively remembered by the public, as the spectacle is remembered by the spectators.
The wall is 114” (w) x 162” (h), with 82+ posters that are 12” (w) x 18” (h). Some will be tiled to be bigger and under, and a lot of posters will be layered to show depth.
